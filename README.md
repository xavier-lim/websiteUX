As part of Accenture's Discovery Program, I created this project to analyze the impact of a web page change on user experience (UX) for the Department for Student Support (DSS). The DSS allows students enrolled in higher education to apply for grants, bursaries, and rebates on their website. After analyzing user journey and user feedback, numerous website changes were made. In this project, I analyze the results of the website change and provide recommendations on how the company can further improve their website.

## Data Source
All the data for this project was collected from [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/prototype/MD2p8dDih7zoQ9KRC/Consulting-Virtual-Internship). The data set presents login information from 5847 DSS website sessions, including the login date, the student's university, whether the session timed out due to inactivity, and whether the user submitted.

## Conclusion
Overall, the Department for Student Support (DSS) website change has definitely improved user experience (UX). Specifically, the number of timeouts have decreased significantly from an average of 65 per day to 20 per day. In addition, the number of successful submissions has nearly doubled from an average of 60 per day to 110 per day.

Despite the significant improvement in UX, the website can be further improved. I discovered numerous inconsistent university data entries that required standardization. In the future, I recommend the DSS implement a dropdown menu for students to input their university. This will ensure university names are consistent which will improve efficiency when performing future analysis. Ultimately, the new website application process is more effective than the original process, but further revisions should be made in future iterations of the website.
